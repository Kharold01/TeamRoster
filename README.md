Katie Harold Team Roster Data Set CMP237

My data set will be comprised of roster information for my team on campus, as well as the men's team (SJC Women/Men's Basketball). Each item in my dataset is a person. It will keep track of their name, gender, jersey number, height in inches, year in school, and basketball position.  

Here is an example of an entry you might find in my dataset:

'{ "playerName": "Katie Harold", "gender": "f", "jerseyNumber": 5, "heightIn": 66, "year": "Senior", "position": "G" }'

With this dataset, I hope to be able to ask questions like:

-how tall is [person] in feet?
-how many seniors are there?
-who are the females?
...and I want to be able to find the right person if I search by number and there are 2 people with the same one.
